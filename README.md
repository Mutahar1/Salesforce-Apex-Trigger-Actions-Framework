## Project Overview

The **Apex Trigger Actions Framework** is a scalable and metadata-driven framework designed to simplify and standardize record-triggered automation on the Salesforce Platform.

It enables developers and administrators to **decouple trigger logic**, **control execution order**, and **combine Apex and Flow automations** in a single, unified model—without continuously modifying trigger code.

This framework introduces an **Automation Studio–style view** of all automations related to a specific sObject, making complex automation ecosystems easier to manage, audit, and evolve.

---

## Business Value

### For Developers

* Clean, modular trigger architecture
* Strong adherence to SOLID principles
* Reduced technical debt and easier extensibility

### For Admins

* Configuration-driven automation using Custom Metadata
* Clear visibility into automation order and behavior
* Flow-first or Apex-first flexibility

### For Enterprises

* Predictable execution order
* Safe bypass mechanisms for integrations and data loads
* Enterprise-ready governance and scalability

---

## Core Principles

The framework is built around proven software design principles:

* **Single Responsibility Principle**
  Each automation action handles one specific responsibility.

* **Open–Closed Principle**
  New automations can be added without modifying existing trigger logic.

* **Strategy Pattern**
  Automation actions are dynamically selected and executed at runtime.

## Metadata-Driven Automation Model

All automation behavior is configured using **Custom Metadata Types**, eliminating hard-coded logic in triggers.

### Core Metadata Objects

* **SObject_Trigger_Setting__mdt**

  * Defines enabled objects
  * Controls trigger contexts
  * Specifies TriggerRecord classes

* **Trigger_Action__mdt**

  * Defines Apex or Flow actions
  * Controls execution order
  * Supports bypass and permissions

* **DML_Finalizer__mdt**

  * Registers finalizers
  * Controls post-transaction execution

---

## Supported Automation Types

* Apex Trigger Actions
* Auto-Launched Flow Trigger Actions
* Change Data Capture (CDC) Flow Actions
* Transaction-Level DML Finalizers

---

## Application Flow

1. Record enters trigger context (insert/update/delete)
2. MetadataTriggerHandler executes
3. Metadata for the object and context is evaluated
4. Apex and Flow actions are executed **in defined order**
5. Entry criteria and bypass rules are applied
6. Optional DML finalizers execute once at transaction end

---

## Key Capabilities

* Metadata-based execution sequencing
* Apex and Flow interoperability
* Per-action entry criteria formulas
* Global and transactional bypass controls
* Recursion prevention utilities
* DML-less unit testing support
* Enterprise-grade extensibility

---

## Apex Trigger Actions

Each automation is implemented as a **small, focused Apex class** that implements one or more TriggerAction interfaces.

Supported interfaces include:

* `BeforeInsert`
* `AfterInsert`
* `BeforeUpdate`
* `AfterUpdate`
* `BeforeDelete`
* `AfterDelete`
* `AfterUndelete`

These actions are dynamically instantiated using reflection at runtime.

⚠️ If an Apex class is referenced in metadata but does not exist or implement the correct interface, a runtime error will occur.

---

## Flow Trigger Actions

The framework supports **auto-launched Flows** as first-class trigger actions.

### Flow Requirements

Flows must define:

* `record` (input/output)
* `recordPrior` (input only, where applicable)

Flows are invoked via:

* `TriggerActionFlow`
* `TriggerActionFlowChangeEvent` (CDC)

⚠️ Flow recursion is limited to a maximum depth of **3** due to platform constraints.

---

## Entry Criteria & Conditional Execution

Each trigger action can define its own **entry criteria formula**, evaluated dynamically at runtime.

* Formula is evaluated per record
* Supports `record` and `recordPrior`
* If empty → action executes for all records

⚠️ Cross-object field traversal is not supported.

---

## Recursion Control & Bypass Mechanisms

### Global Bypass

* Bypass entire objects or actions via metadata checkboxes

### Transaction-Level Bypass

* Bypass objects, Apex actions, or Flows programmatically
* Supported in both Apex and Flow

### User-Based Control

* Required permissions
* Bypass permissions for integrations or admins

---

## DML Finalizers

DML Finalizers execute **exactly once** at the end of a DML transaction.

### Use Cases

* Enqueue async jobs
* Aggregate logs
* Post-commit processing

### Key Characteristics

* No DML allowed inside finalizers
* Independent of triggering sObject
* Metadata-driven execution order

⚠️ Finalizers are experimental and should be used cautiously.

---

## Testing Strategy (DML-less Testing)

The framework enables **zero-DML unit testing** by:

* Generating fake record IDs
* Testing `addError()` logic directly
* Avoiding expensive DML operations

This results in:

* Faster test execution
* Lower CPU usage
* Higher test reliability

---

## Best Practices

* Keep trigger actions small and focused
* Use entry criteria formulas aggressively
* Centralize queries using Singleton patterns
* Guard against recursive execution
* Always configure bypass options for integrations

---

## Setup & Configuration

### Step 1: Enable Trigger

Add `MetadataTriggerHandler().run()` to the object trigger.

### Step 2: Configure SObject Metadata

Create an `SObject_Trigger_Setting__mdt` record.

### Step 3: Define Trigger Actions

Create Apex classes or Flows and register them in `Trigger_Action__mdt`.

### Step 4: (Optional) Configure Finalizers

Register finalizers using `DML_Finalizer__mdt`.

### Step 5: Test & Deploy

Validate order, bypass rules, and recursion behavior.
